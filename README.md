Need: While most of the functionality of this application is focused on the user's personal timeline, I want it to also be a space for people to come together to give tips and tricks or share frustration during their treatment journey.

MVP: personal Timeline focused on cancer treatment eg. Breast Cancer
    comment section that compiles data from other users making the graph dynamic and sense of comradery
